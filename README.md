Analysis of Beto O'Rourke vs. Ted Cruz tweets scrapped from Twitter

This project was done in two day's time as part of our "User Generated Content Analytics" course

Total number of Team Members: 4

The Insights from our analysis are as follows:
* We could see a general trend of major support to Beto (Democrat) nationwide but not so much in Texas.
* The topics extracted using topic modelling indicated general trend of Beto discussing Tedâ€™s views & counterarguing.
* A major support for Ted from rural areas could be observed while the same was observed for Beto from urban areas.
* The topics we got revolved around immigration, gun policies and democratic & republican viewpoints from respective sides.
* We predicted a win by Ted from the numbers from analysis of just Texas data & premise that majority rural population would     not be active on Twitter. (It turned out to be true)

Topic modelling at the end has been done in two ways with LDA:
* Bag of words with word-count using gensim & spacy libraries 
* TF-IDF using gensim

Tools Used:
1. Twitter API
2. Python
3. Natural Language Processing
